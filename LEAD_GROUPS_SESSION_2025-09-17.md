# Lead Groups Implementation Session - September 17, 2025

## Session Overview
**Date**: September 17, 2025  
**Project**: warolabs.com - Lead Groups Management System  
**Framework**: Nuxt 3.17.4 with PostgreSQL

## Context
Working on a lead segmentation system for warolabs.com, a Nuxt.js platform focused on democratizing technology and AI knowledge through virtual events and educational content for Spanish-speaking audiences.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed HTML Compilation Error
- **Issue**: "Element is missing end tag" in `pages/marketing/lead-groups.vue`
- **Solution**: Fixed missing closing div tag and proper HTML structure
- **Files Modified**: `/pages/marketing/lead-groups.vue`

### 2. Removed Preview Functionality
- **Removed**: All preview button and real-time preview logic
- **Reason**: User requested removal of preview functionality completely
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/pages/marketing/lead-groups.vue`
  - `/composables/useLeadGroups.js`

### 3. Implemented Multi-Campaign Selection
- **Feature**: Checkbox system for selecting one, multiple, or all campaigns
- **Implementation**: Changed from single dropdown to multi-checkbox interface
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/pages/marketing/lead-groups.vue` - Added checkbox UI and toggle functions
  - `/server/api/lead-groups/create.post.js` - Updated to handle campaigns array

### 4. Fixed PostgreSQL Array Type Mismatch
- **Issue**: "operator does not exist: character varying[] && text[]"
- **Solution**: Added explicit type casting `campaign_slugs::text[] && ARRAY[...]::text[]`
- **File Modified**: `/server/api/lead-groups/create.post.js`

### 5. Removed UI Components
- **Removed Components**:
  - View details button (eye icon) and associated modal
  - Send campaign button (email icon)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/components/LeadGroupsTable.vue`
  - `/pages/marketing/lead-groups.vue`

## Current Features

### Lead Group Creation
- Create groups from all leads or existing groups
- Multiple filter criteria:
  - Engagement metrics (interactions, opens, clicks)
  - Interaction types (has, exclude, only)
  - Traffic sources (source, medium)
  - Campaign selection (multi-select)
  - Lead status (verified, converted)
  - Recent activity filtering
  - Total interaction ranges

### Database Structure
```sql
-- Tables involved
lead_groups        -- Main groups table
lead_group_members -- Junction table for group membership
leads             -- Main leads table
lead_interactions -- Interaction tracking
campaign_leads    -- Campaign associations
```

## API Endpoints
- `POST /api/lead-groups/create` - Create new lead group
