### API Structure
API routes are organized under `server/api/` with the following pattern:
- `/api/auth/` - Authentication endpoints (magic links, tokens)
- `/api/campaign/` - Email campaign management
- `/api/marketing/` - Marketing and lead capture
- `/api/profiles/` - User profile management
- `/api/landings/` - Landing page data

### Key Utilities
- `server/utils/basedataSettings/withPostgresClient.js` - Database connection wrapper
- `server/utils/aws/sesClient.js` - AWS SES email sending
- `server/utils/security/` - JWT verification and authorization
- `server/utils/emailTemplates/` - Email template rendering

## Configuration

### Database Schema Reference
The complete database schema dump is available in `BASE_DATA_WAROLABS.txt` in the project root. This file contains:
- Complete table definitions with all columns and data types
- Primary key, foreign key, and unique constraints
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Sample data insertions
- **Note**: This file is gitignored for security and should not be committed to the repository

### Environment Variables
The application requires these environment variables (see `nuxt.config.ts`):
- Database: `DATABASE_URL`, `NUXT_PRIVATE_DB_*`
- AWS SES: `NUXT_PRIVATE_AWS_*`
- Authentication: `NUXT_PRIVATE_JWT_SECRET`, `AUTH_SECRET`
- Application: `NUXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`

### Nuxt Configuration
- Runs on port 4000 in development
- Uses node-server preset for production
- Configured for Spanish language (`lang: 'es'`)
- Includes robots.txt configuration blocking AI crawlers from `/api/*`

## Development Patterns

### API Route Pattern
API routes use H3 event handlers with this structure:
```javascript
import { defineEventHandler, readBody } from 'h3';
import { withPostgresClient } from '../../utils/basedataSettings/withPostgresClient';

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  // Authentication check
  await verifyAuthToken(event);
  
  // Get request body
  const body = await readBody(event);
  
  // Database operations
  const result = await withPostgresClient(async (client) => {
    return await client.query(/* SQL */);
  });
  
  return { success: true, data: result };
});
```

### Email Template Rendering
Email templates use Handlebars-style variable substitution:
```javascript
const renderTemplate = (template, data) => {
  return template.replace(/\{\{([a-zA-Z0-9\p{L}_ ]+)\}\}/gu, (match, key) => {
    const trimmedKey = key.trim();
    const value = data[trimmedKey];
    return value !== null && value !== undefined ? value : '';
  });
};
```

### Component Organization
- `components/Commons/` - Shared UI components
- `components/Landings/` - Landing page specific components  
- `components/Marketing/` - Marketing and lead capture components
- `pages/` - Route pages with Vue components
- `layouts/` - Page layouts

## Testing
The project uses Jest for testing. Test files are located in the `test/` directory.

## Docker Support
Includes Docker configuration with:
- `Dockerfile` for containerization
- `docker-compose.yml` for local development
- `docker-compose.override.yml` for environment-specific overrides

# Important Instruction Reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Icons
**ALWAYS use Heroicons for all UI icons.** NEVER use inline SVG icons, emojis as icons, or other icon libraries unless explicitly requested by the user. 
When you need an icon, use Heroicons components or classes, not inline SVG code.

Examples:
- GOOD: `<Icon name="heroicons:home" />` or appropriate Heroicons component
- BAD: `<svg class="w-6 h-6" fill="none" stroke="currentColor">...</svg>`
- BAD: `ðŸ“§` or other emoji as functional icons

### Component Architecture
**ALWAYS componentize reusable UI elements.** Never duplicate code between pages or components.

Rules:
- Create reusable components for any UI element that appears in multiple places
- Components should be placed in appropriate directories (`/components/Commons/`, `/components/Marketing/`, etc.)
- Use proper component naming with PascalCase (e.g., `CampaignCard.vue`, `StatCard.vue`)
- Components should be self-contained with their own props, emits, and styles

### Loading States
**ALWAYS use Teleport for loading states.** Never use inline loading spinners.

Rules:
- Use `<Teleport to="body">` for all loading overlays
- Create a reusable `LoadingOverlay.vue` component
- Loading should cover the entire viewport, not just individual components
- Use consistent loading animations across the application

### Data Management and API Calls
**ALWAYS prioritize Nuxt's built-in composables over manual implementations.** Never duplicate API calls or data fetching logic.

Rules:
- Use `useFetch()` instead of `$fetch()` for automatic SSR, caching, and loading states
- Use `useLazyFetch()` for client-side only data fetching
- Create composables for shared data logic (e.g., `useTemplates()`, `useCampaigns()`)
- Use Pinia stores for global state that needs to persist across components
- Eliminate duplicate API calls - centralize data fetching
- Data should load immediately on component mount, not after loading screens
- Use Nuxt's reactive data to eliminate blank screens between loading and content

Examples:
- GOOD: `<Teleport to="body"><LoadingOverlay v-if="loading" /></Teleport>`
- BAD: `<div v-if="loading" class="spinner">Loading...</div>`
